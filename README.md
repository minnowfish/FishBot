# FishBot

FishBot is a Tetris bot created over the summer holiday as a project. It uses a beam search algorithm to determine the optimal piece placements base on the heuristics defined. 

As of the moment, the heuristic considers:
- Number of line clears
- Number of cavities/holes on the board
- Bumpiness of the board
